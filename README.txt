**[SIGN UP - IT's FREE](https://admin.nearplace.com/register/)**

NearPlace is the most user-friendly, and at the same time very advanced, locator of places and stores in the world. Apart from its basic function like a locator of stationary stores, it enables finding basic as well as detailed information about the place, finding places near the client and designating a route to them. NearPlace is extremely easy to manage globally for all places or for each store individually - thanks to this you always have actual news, opening hours, products, services and many, many more.
The NearPlace team regrets the quality of current locators that are ugly and non-functional - we want you to connect your offline places online completely for free! If you will see the benefits of using NearPlace you can switch to premium version to develop your business more. 

NearPlace has created two types of locators that work on any device - they display well everywhere and look beautiful.
